            I can't tell if the changes are fixes, features or breaking, you'll have to figure that out on yourself and adapt the commit messages accordingly to trigger the right release, see [our commit message conventions](https://github.com/octokit/routes/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#merging-the-pull-request--releasing-a-new-version).
